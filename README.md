# Starbucks-customer-feedback-analysis
  This project was a deep dive into understanding customer behavior and satisfaction using survey data collected from Starbucks customers in Malaysia. As a team, we wanted to explore what influences people’s decisions when it comes to choosing Starbucks—whether for a quick coffee run, a relaxed hangout, or a business meeting.

We worked with a real-world dataset of 122 survey responses, covering details like Wi-Fi quality, ambiance, service ratings, pricing perception, and demographic info (age, gender, employment status, etc.). Using Python, R, and Excel, we cleaned the data, built visualizations, and developed predictive models to answer four core questions:

Do students and working professionals differ in their Starbucks preferences?

How does distance to a Starbucks outlet affect dining behavior?

What factors predict customer loyalty and repeat visits?

Does service quality impact the likelihood of choosing Starbucks for meetings or socializing?

We applied both logistic and ordinal regression models to analyze the factors driving customer loyalty and hangout preferences. Interestingly, while ambiance and price perception had a strong positive influence on loyalty, high expectations for Wi-Fi and service actually decreased the likelihood of return visits—possibly due to higher disappointment risk.
